    "\n",
    "Python has been chosen as the main language of this book, for several reasons.\n",
    "It doesn't have too much jargon, and the signal-to-noise ratio in code is very high (it's almost pseudocode). \n",
    "While Python is not the optimal language for scientific computing, it is familiar to most people with basic knowledge of programming, and the learning curve for Python is not as steep as C++, Java, or Julia. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "One of the drawbacks associated with using Python is that it doesn't handle large graphs or datasets very well. C++ and Java both deal with larger structures more efficiently, and many authors of seminal papers in the field of GIS provide C++ and Java implementations alongside their papers. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Julia, on the other hand, is a perfect midpoint between python and C++/Java. It maintains the readability of Python but was developed specifically for scientific computing applications. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For the sake of accessibility, the examples and exercises in this book will be based entirely in Python. Implementations in other languages are welcome as pull requests. Simply make a PR of this repo and we'll include any submissions that look promising.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "From this point forward, the book will assume that you already have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system. For installation instructions specific to your operating system, see this [Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "There are two primary ways to install the required packages you'll need: `pip` or `conda`. It is recommended to use `pip` as `conda` may have some adverse effects on system dependencies when used improperly in Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "If you intend on developing in Windows, it is also recommended that you leverage the convenience of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This allows you to use the full capabilities of Linux from within Windows. You can read more about setting up WSL [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). After enabling WSL, you can proceed with the rest of this book as if you were operating in Linux.\n",

    "\n",
    "After installing Python, you may need to restart your computer in order for the changes to take effect.\n",
    "\n",

This can be disabled by going to \"Apps and Features\", selecting \"Application Execution Aliases\", and disabling the sliders for any application related to `python` (i.e. `python3.8.exe`, `py.exe`).\n",
    "2. `pip3` is sometimes not added to the system PATH by default. You may choose to add it manually, or simply use `pip`, as it should link to the same program.\n",

    "## Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data used in this book will be sourced from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org). For any other datasets that are not OSM-related, you can download the data in whatever format it is available in, and import it into `python` using the appropriate methods. Open Data websites hosted by various government bodies are a great source of data related to infrastructure, population metrics, and land use. See the [Datasets](../Datasets/index.md) section in this book for more details. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For OpenStreetMaps, there are two primary ways of retrieving the data:\n",
    "1. Download the data as-is from OpenStreetMaps' website and use tools like `osmfilter` to tune it as needed. This is not recommended as it is more difficult and not very efficient.\n",
    "2. Use OpenStreetMaps' API (Overpass API) to query for data. This filters the data on the fly and you only retrieve what you need. The API is accessible in both Java and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Data Completeness\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "The data from OSM is not always \"complete\". This doesn't mean that there are major uncharted regions, but rather that neighbouring nodes are not always grouped correctly. For some nodes where there are feasible connections between them in real life, OSM still represents them as having no [way](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way) or [relation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) connecting them. This means that using the `osmnx` parser will result in the nodes being placed in separate graph components, which is not accurate to real-world conditions. We can use `osrm` to find routes between these kinds of nodes and thus \"complete\" the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the completeness of OpenStreetMaps data here:\n",
    "1. [Completeness](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Completeness)\n",
    "2. [Completeness Metrics](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ONS_Completeness_Metrics)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data model of OpenStreetMaps is surprisingly simple and consists only of three [elements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements): </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Node` represents a specific point on the earth's surface defined by its latitude and longitude\n",
    "2. `Way` is an ordered list of between 2 and 2,000 nodes that define a polyline. Ways are used to represent linear features such as rivers and roads\n",
    "3. `Relation` is a multi-purpose data structure that documents a relationship between two or more data elements (nodes, ways, and/or other relations). Examples include:\n",
    "    * A route relation, which lists the ways that form a major (numbered) highway, a cycle route, or a bus route.\n",
    "    * A turn restriction that describes if a turn can be made from one way onto another.\n",
    "    * A multipolygon that describes an area (whose boundary is the 'outer way') with holes (the 'inner ways').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above can be found easily on the linked elements page, but there are two things you should be aware of: \n",
    "1. All ID's of the same element type are unique globally, but they are not unique across element types (you can find a `Way` with the same ID as a `Node`).\n",
    "2. `Ways` and `Relations` are made by listing and referring to the ID's of the `Nodes` that constitute them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Querying points of interest (POIs) using Overpass API\n",
    "\n",
    "Overpass API is OSM's querying API. It is incredibly powerful in that it can very quickly return queried features, and allows for selection of location, tags, proximity, and more.\n",

    "## Compile your dataset\n",
    "You can compile your own dataset using the [Overpass QL](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL) language that runs on [Overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/). You can use this query language to mine OpenStreetMaps data, filter it, and get it ready to be used by `osmnx` or any library that parses `.osm` files. Below is a quick review about using [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API), which is the official API for reading data from OpenStreetMap servers. All the online [routing services and software](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing/online_routers) use it. Additionally, we will usually use [Nominatim](https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim) to do geocoding/geo-decoding; translating addresses to/from (latitude-longitude). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also be aware of the fact that most of the time if you are building a dataset over a very big area in the map, the graph parsed from the data by `osmnx` won't be complete, even though there are physically feasible routes that could make the graph complete and connect all the nodes. This deficiency is usually because of the incomplete [relations](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) and data of `osm` -- don't worry about that now.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these cases, we will be using [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) to fill these gaps when needed, with the help of some utilities in `utilities/src/poi.py`. This can be seen in some of the case studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `OverPass QL`\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire up [Overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) and run these scripts and export it as `.osm` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**All hospitals around UofT**](scripts/hospitals_toronto.oql)\n",
    "* [**All Tim Hortons in Canada**](scripts/tim_hortons_canada.oql)\n",
    "* [**All fast food or restaurant places in London**](scripts/restaurant_fastfood_london.oql)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the bounding box around an area of interest is a recurring problem in writing `OverPass QL` queries. To solve for that, we can use [bbox finder](http://bboxfinder.com/). Don't forget to change the coordinate format to latitude/longitude at the right corner after drawing the polygon around the area of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `Overpass turbo`'s Wizard\n",
    "[Overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/)'s Wizard provides an easy way to auto-generate Overpass QL queries. Wizard syntax is similar to that of a search engine. An example of Wizard syntax is `amenity=hospital` that generates an Overpass QL query to find all the hospitals in a certain region of interest. Hospital locations will be visualized on the map and can be downloaded/copied using the \"Export\" button. The data can be exported as GeoJSON, GPX, KML, raw OSM data, or raw data directly from Overpass API. You can then use `osmnx` to read `.osm` files with [`osmnx.graph_from_xml`](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/osmnx.html?highlight=from%20file#osmnx.graph.graph_from_xml).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of `Overpass turbo`'s wizard syntax include:\n",
    "* **`amenity=restaurant in \"Toronto, Canada\"`** to find all resturants in City of Toronto.\n",
    "* **`amenity=cafe and name=\"Tim Hortons\"`** to find all Tim Hortons coffee shops.\n",
    "* **`(amenity=hospital or amenity=school) and (type:way)`** to find hospitals and schools with close ways mapped.\n",
    "* **`amenity=hospital and name~\"General Hospital\"`** will find all hospitals with \"General Hospital\" part of their names. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {note}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contributing:** Do you have something cool and want to share it with us? If you collected your data by downloading it directly from OpenStreetMaps and did some filtering with `osmfilter`, open a pull request with the details of the data and how you filtered it. If you collected your data with [overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/), please attach your `Overpass QL` script with the data so we can replicate your results, and maybe we can learn a thing or two from your script.\n",
