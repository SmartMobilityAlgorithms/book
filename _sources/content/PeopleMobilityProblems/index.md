# People Mobility Problems

Ill-structured problems (ISPs) are complex discrete/continuous problems without algorithmic solutions or general problem solvers and can be characterized by one or more features such as:
- lack of mathematical models
- data imperfection
- unclear goals
- different views of the problem
- conflicting solutions
- stochastic actions
- context sensitivity

In the context of smart mobility, ISPs can be categorized into people mobility problems, logistics problems, and infrastructure problems.
